Surgical resection of the tumor: If the lesions are confirmed to be tumors, surgical removal may be necessary to alleviate mass effect and prevent further complications.\n\nB. Corticosteroids to reduce cerebral edema: If the lesions are causing increased intracranial pressure or edema, corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and swelling.\n\nC.

    "prediction": "Based on the histological features observed in the image, the tissue appears to be a tumor or cancerous lesion. The dense, irregular cellular arrangement and the presence of distinct cellular structures suggest an aggressive, proliferative tumor. To address this type of tissue, the most appropriate treatment strategies would be:\n\nA. Immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4): These therapies work by blocking the inhibitory signals that prevent T cells from effectively attacking cancer cells. By removing these inhibitory signals, the immune system can mount a more robust anti-tumor response.\n\nB. CAR-T cell therapy targeting tumor-associated antigens: This approach involves engineering a patient's own T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that recognize specific antigens expressed by the tumor cells. The modified T cells can then directly target and eliminate the cancer cells.\n\nC. Radiation therapy to directly eliminate infiltrating lymphocytes: While radiation therapy is typically used to target tumor cells, it can also have an immunomodulatory effect by inducing the release of tumor antigens and promoting an anti-tumor immune response.\n\nD. Therapeutic cancer vaccines to enhance T cell activation: Cancer vaccines can be designed to stimulate the patient's immune system to recognize and attack specific tumor antigens, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor immune response.\n\nE. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors specifically targeting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs): While FGFR inhibitors are primarily used to target certain types of solid tumors, they may also have an impact on the tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration.\n\nBased on the histological features observed in the image, the most appropriate treatment strategies would be:\n\nA. Immune checkpoint blockade (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4)\n\nB. CAR-T cell therapy targeting tumor-associated antigens\n\nC. Radiation therapy to directly eliminate infiltrating lymphocytes\n\nD.

The surgical field is a rectangular area, so we can use the dimensions of the field to find the coordinates of the corners.\n\nLet's assume the surgical field has a width of W and a height of H.
